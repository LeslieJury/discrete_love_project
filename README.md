Hello! I just released my first ever game for early access! It's still in development but I would love some feedback and to show everyone my new game!

AI Disclosure:

I used AI generation to create the characters and logos, in a future release I would like to use better art of each character.

Release Notes:

I haven't finished the meta world ending, so selecting "visit the real world" will lead you to the basic end of the game.

The dating sim part isn't really polished, it's still fun, but I just added it, so I'll fix the sprites and make them PNGs in 1.1!
